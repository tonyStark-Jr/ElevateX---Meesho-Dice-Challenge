## 2) Strengthened Product Recommendation System  

### Problems Solved:
1. **Limited Product Discovery:**  
   Enhances product visibility by providing personalized recommendations based on user data.
2. **Feedback Underutilization:**  
   Integrates user feedback and sentiments to improve recommendation accuracy.
3. **Inadequate Purchase Insights:**  
   Utilizes time spent on products to gauge interest and optimize suggestions.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Feature Collection:**  
   Gather user features such as age, gender, locality, and purchase history.
2. **Feedback Integration:**  
   Utilize feedback collected through MuRIL, including TF-IDF analysis and sentiment data.
3. **Time Spent Analysis:**  
   Track and analyze the time users spend on products to identify areas of interest.
4. **Feature Normalization:**  
   Normalize all collected features for consistent analysis.
5. **Pearson Correlation Similarity:**  
   Calculate similarity scores between users based on demographic features and feedback data.
6. **Product Recommendations:**  
   Generate tailored product suggestions based on clustering results and user interests.

## 3) Socialifying the Shopping Experience  

### Problems Solved:
1. **Limited Personalization:**  
   Provides tailored product recommendations based on user demographics and social connections.
2. **Lack of Social Shopping Experience:**  
   Enables users to connect and shop collaboratively with friends and twins.
3. **Underutilized Feedback:**  
   Integrates user feedback to recommend products of interest that were not purchased.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Feature Collection:**  
   Gather user features such as age, gender, locality, and purchase history.
2. **Feature Normalization:**  
   Normalize the collected features for consistent analysis.
3. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**  
   Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and highlight significant features.
4. **K-Means Clustering:**  
   Use online K-Means clustering for real-time friend recommendations based on similar interests.
5. **Silhouette Score Evaluation:**  
   Analyze silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters for effective grouping.
6. **Friend Recommendations:**  
   Recommend friends based on clustering results, enhancing the social shopping experience.
